This code is written in the JavaScript library P5.js. P5.js is a client-side library that simplifies the process of creating interactive graphics and animations in JavaScript by providing a set of intuitive drawing functions and event handlers.

The code uses several P5.js functions to create and update the canvas, draw shapes, handle user input, and generate Perlin noise. For example, createCanvas() is used to create the canvas, ellipse() is used to draw the control point circles, bezierVertex() is used to draw the Bezier curve, and text() is used to draw the text on the curve. The P5.js functions mousePressed(), mouseDragged(), mouseReleased(), and keyPressed() are used to handle user input, while noise() is used to generate Perlin noise for the control points.

Overall, P5.js provides an easy-to-use and powerful set of tools for creating interactive programs and animations in JavaScript, which is why it is widely used in the creative coding community.
